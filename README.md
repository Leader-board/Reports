# Reports

Blog-like posts, giving an insight into my thoughts.
These reports give readers an interesting peek on what I think and experience, and are written in a similar format to how I write my reports in Computer Science as part of my coursework.

Some of them would have been written for a specific purpose and will hence be written in a more formal manner. Additionally, note that some of them would have been conceived before I came to university

### The Mathematics Standard and Higher (Maths S-H) proposal

*Available at https://github.com/Leader-board/MathsSHproposal*

My aim is to provide a comprehensive framework for the potential improvement of the Mathematics curriculum of CBSE (cbse.nic.in) for Class 11 and 12. While I mostly focus on that, I also touch upon the overall examination pattern - as you'll see, some of the improvements are effective for all subjects.

While a completed RTM version was made available well back in June 2018, CBSE has not responded (yet) to my repeated emails urging them to consider this request. Perhaps you can help?

### Maths Analysis

*Available at https://github.com/Leader-board/MathsAnalysis*

Conceived way back in August 2016, it was originally intended as a vehicle for my ideas, some of them which were quite novel back then (at least it seemed so for those who I knew). This was originally intended for a mathematical competition, which I failed (as usual), and the only feedback I received suggested that my work was poor.

But then I started working on new ideas and wrote my results in them. Personally, I liked the summation forumla that I derived (Q5; section 5.6): $$\sum\limits ^{n}_{x=1} \sin\ (x) =2^{k} \sin\ \left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right) \prod ^{k}_{i=2}\cos\left(\frac{n}{2^{i}}\right)\sum\limits ^{\frac{n}{2^{k}}}_{i=1} \left[ \, \cos\ \left(\frac{2^{k-1} +( i-1) 2^{k} \ -n}{2^{k}}\right)\right] \ $$

(hello Github, please support LaTeX thank you)

I worked on these ideas during sporatic times throughout 2017.
